# Terraria Source Getter

A CLI tool to get compile-able decompiled Terraria server source code by one click.  
It's an alternative of our [Pryaxis/Sources](https://github.com/Pryaxis/Sources) repo.  

## Usage

Download the artifact in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Pryaxis/TerrariaSourceGetter/actions) and run it, it's all.   
Or you can pass a path argument to decompile a specific terraria assembly (you can drag'n'drop if you have desktop environment).
